# Facemask-Classification-Project

This is my first attempt to code-along with Krish Nair (https://youtu.be/p1bfK8ZJgkE) for an end-to-end deep learning project. 
Credits and many thanks to Krish Nair for the tutorial and @harry418 on Kaggle for the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harry418/dataset-for-mask-detection).
